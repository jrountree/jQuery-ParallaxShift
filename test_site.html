				<p class="font-1 fsize-1">full of unforgiving regret for years of failure and compromise;</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">It’s mouth opened wide, exposing jagged gaped teeth and a tongue the color of blood.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">Meeting a grizzly would mean certain death for the old man, unless the grizzly happened to be charitable; which most are not.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">rolling his stiff body into those moth eaten musky blankets that have never been washed.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-3">creating a putrid dark-water pond which is probably home to mutated diseases that would make gonorrhea seem pleasant.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">neighbors at the time had a mangy dog that had a habit of getting into their trash.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">He fancied himself to be independent from society, and spent his young adulthood striving for what would end up to be his home now.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">The image in front of him is not what he could have ever imagined to be his wife; so distant; so cold.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">spent most of the afternoon lying on his back in middle of the bio-hazard mess in his kitchen.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">Still dark with shadows and grey light, the room gave off an ominous impression.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">which only makes him hate himself even more; to feel that way about his wife, shameful.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="slide midground">
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">A dead bird lies in the toilet, probably flew in the broken window and landed on the toilet seat, only to faint from the toxic fumes and drown in the bowl; a canary would laugh.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">Creatures of unnameable horror would tear at his flesh and sink their spinney teeth into his neck.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">A spider had made a web across her leathery hands.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-2">the baby extends out it’s little grey hands stained in dried blood with sharp little finger nails.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-3">Her warmth gone, her eyes alive but empty, and her tender, beautiful voice unspoken in so long.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">Spider webs have created a thick blanket over most of the mantle.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">Every day he prays for a fire or an earthquake to take down his home.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">His shriek of pain could be heard from across the canyon when he forced himself to a sitting position.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">mostly, even now, laying in his hallway splintered and soaking in a pool of vomit.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">the old man was looking straight into a pot of molded grime.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">All of him sat in that chair, and it did not know he existed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="slide foreground">
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">had never seen a bath and it’s hair was matted and clumped with grime.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">“If you love me, please kill me.”</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">By nightfall, both will be still.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">The kitchen smells like something died.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">His heart is bleeding from the inside out, and all she can do is stare straight ahead.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-1">a painful warm sensation shot up his spine and stiffened his body.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">the old excruciating pain coming back with a vengeance.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">The fact her warmth is all but gone hurts him more than</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">She just sits there staring forward, totally unresponsive to the his pain.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-3">He hunkered over the counter and cringed.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">His tear ducts swell with mucous, his lungs catch on fire</p>

			<div class="slide background">
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">Flowers and tall grasses would lean into her as she walked through the fields behind their house; drawn to her beauty and tenderness.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">The amber light of the dieing sun turning everything into gold, and the world would be perfect.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">They may hate the world, but they love each other fully, and the morning was their favorite time.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">Her skin was clear and smooth, and her eyes shimmered in the light.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">The autumn leaves drifting down from the canopy above seem to dance to the soft melody.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-1">He cursed God, his mother, his father, himself, but never his wife.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">The old man can remember when they were younger, how she warmed the room simply by entering.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">his wife would sporadically say she loved him and would sneak up from behind just to give him a hug.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-1">The picture held in his hand began to shake and his heart was nearly pounding out of his chest.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">The old man remembers her grace in dance; how he missed her.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">and all were wonderful; her dancing, her reaching out for him, her singing along, her walking towards him.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="slide midground">
				<p class="font-1 fsize-3">Dust was floating in the air and in the silvery light sparkled.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">with his wife by his side; her body pressed against him with her legs folded into his.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">He would imagine his grandchildren playing in the grassy field of a mountain home</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-3">He held her close, holding her face into his chest.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-2">flying a kite and dancing in the smoke stream from the barbecue</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">stand again at about the time the sun was crawling down beneath the purple mountains.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-3">He’d watch his daughter toss his granddaughter in the air, listening to the baby laugh with explosive joy.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">His wife knitting a thick warm blanket in a rocking chair on the porch,</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-2">He thought he might have imagined her, wanting so badly to have her back to her old self.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-3">slowly dancing to soft music playing on their crummy radio.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-1">He let out a shriek of joy and spun around to see if his wife was paying attention.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="slide foreground">
				<p class="font-3 fsize-3">content with the setting sun sitting on her back.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">“Dance with me.”</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-3">he rocked her back and forth in his arms</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">her, a beautiful tunedanced out of the speakers and filled the room</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">their arms wrapped around each other as if in the middle of a dance,</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-3">As it gets closer, the laughter grows louder and more elated.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">He only remembers being very loved by his mother and father</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">He misses her more than anything.</p>
				<p class="font-2 fsize-3">the old man searched the dark for his wife.</p>
				<p class="font-3 fsize-1">her, but the old man can still find her beauty.</p>
				<p class="font-1 fsize-2">She can dance, she will dance, she just needs music.</p>
